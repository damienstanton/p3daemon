{"name":"P3daemon","tagline":"Turn any Python script into a Unix daemon. Works on 3.x and 2.7.x","body":"![](https://travis-ci.org/damienstanton/p3daemon.svg?branch=master)\r\n\r\nThis is a Python class that will daemonize your Python script so it can continue running in the background. It works on Unix, Linux and OS X, creates a PID file and has standard commands (start, stop, restart) + a foreground mode.\r\n\r\nBased on [python-daemon](https://github.com/serverdensity/python-daemon) by [dmytton](https://github.com/dmytton) which is in turn based on [this original version from jejik.com](http://www.jejik.com/articles/2007/02/a_simple_unix_linux_daemon_in_python/).\r\n\r\nI have made slight modifications to allow this to work properly in modern versions of Python 3 as well as 2.7. Usage and documentation has not changed otherwise from the original version.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nDefine a class which inherits from `Daemon` and has a `run()` method (which is what will be called once the daemonization is completed.\r\n\r\n\tfrom daemonizer import Daemon\r\n\t\r\n\tclass daemon(Daemon):\r\n\t\tdef run(self):\r\n\t\t\tprint(\"Test Okay\")\r\n  \r\n\r\nCreate a new object of your class, specifying where you want your PID file to exist:\r\n  \t\r\n  \tdaemon_object = daemon(\"./pid.pid\")\r\n  \tdaemon_object.start()\t\r\n\r\nActions\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n* `start()` - starts the daemon (creates PID and daemonizes).\r\n* `stop()` - stops the daemon (stops the child process and removes the PID).\r\n* `restart()` - does `stop()` then `start()`.\r\n\r\nForeground\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nThis is useful for debugging because you can start the code without making it a daemon. The running script then depends on the open shell like any normal Python script.\r\n\r\nTo do this, just call the `run()` method directly.\r\n\r\n\tdaemon_object.run()\r\n\r\nContinuous execution\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nThe `run()` method will be executed once so if you want the daemon to be doing stuff continuously you may wish to use the [sched][1] module to execute code repeatedly ([example][2]).\r\n\r\nDistributed under the `MIT license`\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://docs.python.org/library/sched.html\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/boxedice/sd-agent/blob/master/agent.py#L226\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
